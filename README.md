# Leap-Year-Detector

This program determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

## Algorithm

This program uses a nested if-else statement to determine whether a year is a leap year or not.
  -  A year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.
  -  The program uses the input() function to get user input and the int() function to convert the input to an integer.
  -  The program uses f-strings to format the output message.
